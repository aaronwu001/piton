# Milestone gamma - the automated suite.
#
# CLAUDE.md 4 step 6: this suite job is to guarantee that what the owner saw by
# hand stays true. It does not replace step 5, and a green run the owner has
# never looked behind is not evidence the milestone landed.
#
#   ./test/gamma/run.sh              run every group
#   ./test/gamma/run.sh -run Retry   pass any flag straight through to go test
#
# Everything executes inside WSL (CLAUDE.md 8). The suite needs docker and the
# Go toolchain; it needs no psql, because it reaches the database through
# `docker compose exec postgres psql`, exactly as demo.sh does.
#
# WHY -p 1
#   CLAUDE.md 5.5.1 brings up one docker-compose environment per group and tears
#   it down, volume wipe included, before the next group starts. Gamma has one
#   group today, but -p 1 is what keeps that true when it gains a second, and it
#   also stops this suite from racing alpha for the published port 8080 if the
#   two are ever run from one command.
#
# WHY -count=1
#   A cached PASS would report that a milestone still holds without having
#   started a container at all.
