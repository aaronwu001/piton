# Milestone alpha - the demo script.
#
# SPEC.md 18.1 is the authority for everything below. CLAUDE.md 4 step 2 asks
# for "literally: the commands the operator will type in a terminal, and the
# database state he must see afterwards", and CLAUDE.md 5.1 permits exactly one
# source for a test - SPEC.md. Every assertion here cites the section it came
# from. Nothing here was derived by reading an implementation, because none
# exists yet: this script is written before the code (CLAUDE.md 4, R20-a).
#
# WHAT IT DEMONSTRATES (SPEC.md 18.1)
#   An operator creates a workflow with a static planner, starts a run, and the
#   run walks through every static step against a sync envelope worker and
#   reaches DONE.
#
# HOW TO RUN IT
#   cd demos/alpha && ./demo.sh
#
#   Everything runs inside WSL (CLAUDE.md 8). The script needs curl, jq and
#   docker on the host; it needs no psql, because it reaches the database
#   through `docker compose exec postgres psql`.
#
#   Exit status 0 means every assertion held. Any other status means the
#   milestone did not land, and the failing assertion is named on stdout.
#
# WHAT THE SCRIPT PRINTS, AND IN WHICH VOICE
#   Section 4 prints SPEC.md 18.1's five queries and their output unedited, for
#   the operator's eye. That is step 5 of CLAUDE.md 4 - the hand-run inspection
#   that the automated suite may never replace.
#   Sections 5 and 6 then assert. Section 5 holds only what SPEC.md 18.1
#   literally requires. Section 6 holds checks derived from other ratified SPEC
#   sections, kept separate so the owner can see exactly which are which.
#
# THE WORKFLOW, EXPLAINED
#   workflow.json cannot carry this comment - SPEC.md 9.1 forbids a .json file
#   whose content is not JSON, and JSON has no comments - so it lives here.
#
#   * planner_type is "static". SPEC.md 6.1: the built-in static planner
#     answers planner_static_steps[n] where n is the number of steps the run
#     already has, and answers "done" once n reaches the end of the array. It
#     never answers "fail", which is why SPEC.md 18.1 expects
#     planner_attempt_count = 0 (SPEC.md 12.1 states this explicitly).
#   * Every step is sync + envelope. SPEC.md 9.7 makes that the only legal
#     combination in alpha; sync + raw is theta and async + envelope is epsilon.
#   * timeout_seconds and max_attempts are omitted from every StepSpec, not
#     written as null. SPEC.md 9.8 rule 5 rejects a non-null value before
#     milestone eta, and SPEC.md 9.4 already defaults them to null.
#   * The first step carries "input_from": [], which SPEC.md 9.4 defines as
#     "nothing". Steps 2 and 3 omit input_from, which SPEC.md 9.4 defines as
#     "the previous step only". Those are the only two values a static planner
#     can use - input_from is an array of step_id, and step_ids are UUIDs
#     assigned at run time, which a static array cannot know. Section 6 asserts
#     that both behaved as SPEC.md 9.4 says.
#   * The five configuration numbers are written out at SPEC.md 11.1's own
#     defaults, so the file documents the shape rather than relying on it.
#
# ONE THING THAT SURPRISES EVERY FIRST READER
#   The run is created with input {"text":"hello"}, and no worker ever sees it.
#   SPEC.md 9.5's envelope carries params and inputs and no workflow input; the
#   run's input reaches a planner (SPEC.md 9.2 workflow_input) and the static
#   planner ignores it by construction. The input is therefore asserted where
#   it does live - runs.input, SPEC.md 6.2, "stored verbatim" - and nowhere
#   else. This is correct alpha behaviour, not a gap.
#
# TWO PLACES WHERE SPEC.md 18.1's SQL IS ADJUSTED, AND WHY
#   1. octet_length(output) becomes octet_length(output::text). SPEC.md 7.1
#      says the Postgres implementation stores JSON columns as jsonb, and
#      Postgres has no octet_length(jsonb). The cast is also correct if a
#      backend chose text or bytea instead.
#   2. :run becomes :'run'. Same placeholder; :'run' is psql's form that quotes
#      the substituted value.
#
# THE ONE COLUMN 18.1 SELECTS WITHOUT STATING AN EXPECTATION
#   runs.owner_id. SPEC.md 18.1 prints it and says nothing about it, but
#   SPEC.md 6.2's runs invariants do: "owner_id and claimed_at are non-NULL
#   only while status = 'RUNNING', and are always written and cleared as a
#   pair". The run is DONE, so both must be NULL, and section 6 asserts exactly
#   that.
#
#   SPEC.md 8.7 carries the mechanism that makes the invariant true rather than
#   merely asserted: coordination metadata is written in four places, the
#   fourth being "any transition of a run out of RUNNING", which covers the
#   three exits DONE, DLQ and CANCELLED. Both sections are ratified, so this is
#   a derivation and not an assumption - CLAUDE.md 5.1 permits SPEC as a test's
#   only source.
