# Milestone gamma - the demo script.
#
# SPEC.md 18.2 is the authority for everything below. CLAUDE.md 4 step 2 asks
# for "literally: the commands the operator will type in a terminal, and the
# database state he must see afterwards", and CLAUDE.md 5.1 permits exactly one
# source for a test - SPEC.md. Every assertion here cites the section it came
# from. Nothing was derived by reading the implementation.
#
# WHAT IT DEMONSTRATES (SPEC.md 18.2)
#   An operator watches a step attempts burn against a failing worker -
#   recovering on the last one in leg 1, and exhausting step_max_attempts into
#   the dead-letter queue in legs 2, 3 and 4, one for each way a worker fails.
#
#     leg 1  fail twice, succeed on the third and last attempt
#     leg 2  worker replies 200 with a failure envelope   -> worker_error
#     leg 3  worker replies HTTP 500                      -> transport_error
#     leg 4  nothing listening on the port                -> transport_error
#
#   Legs 3 and 4 share a failure_reason on purpose. SPEC.md 5.3 defines
#   transport_error as "the HTTP exchange did not produce a usable reply -
#   non-2xx, connection refused, DNS failure, connection reset", so a demo that
#   showed only one of them would leave half of that definition unexercised.
#
# HOW TO RUN IT
#   cd demos/gamma && ./demo.sh
#
#   Everything runs inside WSL (CLAUDE.md 8). The script needs curl, jq and
#   docker on the host; it needs no psql, because it reaches the database
#   through `docker compose exec postgres psql`.
#
#   Exit status 0 means every assertion held. Any other status means the
#   milestone did not land, and the failing assertion is named on stdout.
#
# WHAT THE SCRIPT PRINTS, AND IN WHICH VOICE
#   Each leg prints SPEC.md 18.2 queries and their output unedited, for the
#   operator eye. That is step 5 of CLAUDE.md 4 - the hand-run inspection the
#   automated suite may never replace. It then asserts.
#
# WHY FOUR RUNS AND NOT ONE
#   A run stops at the first step that exhausts its budget (SPEC.md 12.2:
#   step -> DLQ and run -> DLQ in one transaction), so three ways of failing
#   cannot be shown by one run. All four legs run against ONE environment,
#   which is what SPEC.md 18.2 requires of demo.sh.
#
# WHY EACH DLQ LEG DECLARES A SECOND STATIC STEP THAT IS NEVER CREATED
#   SPEC.md 18.2 requires "no step created after it". A workflow whose
#   planner_static_steps ends at the failing step could not show that: there
#   would be nothing the planner could have created even if it had been asked.
#   The second element makes the absence evidence rather than a tautology.
