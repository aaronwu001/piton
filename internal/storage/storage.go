// Package storage is the interface SPEC.md 7 makes a conformance requirement,
// and nothing else. Postgres is today's only implementation (internal/storage/
// postgres); SPEC.md 4.4 makes the backend a value in the configuration file
// precisely so that it is not a hard-coded assumption.
//
// SPEC.md 7.1: every JSON document crosses this boundary as opaque []byte —
// run inputs, step decisions, step and attempt outputs. No signature here
// mentions jsonb or any other backend-specific type.
//
// The method set is shaped by SPEC.md 8 rather than by the tables. Each write
// that constitutes a decision is one method, because each one must open with
// the ownership fence of SPEC.md 8.2 and commit as a unit; exposing a
// transaction handle instead would move that obligation to the caller, and
// SPEC.md 8.2 rejects exactly that: "one forgotten statement silently breaks
// the whole guarantee".
